7. AI-powered face motion detector
   - I've used Google's Mediapipe library to track the motion of the user's face
   - This app can check if a user is trying to cheat by monitoring the co-ordinates of their face
   - The face detection is performed on-device without sending anything to the backend
   - Thus, the Face detection is fast and real-time
